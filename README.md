**CSFS (Chris' Simple File System)**

Very simple P2P Decentralized glorified copy-and-paste that happens to work across computers, and only for files.

When files are uploaded to the tracked folder, the system automatically sends them to all clients connected to the session.

Very easy to deploy: clone this repo, change BOOTSTRAP_NODE_IP and TRACKED_FOLDER_PATH to the node that created the session and your local folder you want everything downloaded to/uploaded from respectively. Then just run, create or join, wait for a bit to join the network, and you can start sending files!
